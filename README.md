## In this repositery we are building a simple Convolution Neural Network and also writing a blog to understand the concepts behind the Convolution Neural Network.

- We are using the [Caltech101 | Airplanes, Motorbikes & Schooners](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maricinnamon/caltech101-airplanes-motorbikes-schooners) from Kaggle.
- We will understand which problems handled by Convolution Nueral network architecture.
- We will perform experiment on layers,batch size etc to better understand their effects.

It's recommended to start with this [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/@yogesh.grjr4/convolution-neural-network-43d0380d229d)
